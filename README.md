Spiral-blog, Version 1.0
---

A simple blog engine written in clojure using
[Hiccup](www.github.com/weavejester/hiccup), and
[Gaka](www.github.com/briancarper/gaka). The goal is to be as minimal
as reasonable. The posts are stored as a flat database, and the entire
blog is static HTML, generated by the program once.

Configuration
---

The configuration file is simply a clojure file that contains some
defs. All the defs in default.cfg must be included, and the
\*out-folder\* variable must be redefined by the user. All other values
are the hardcoded defaults. The \*syntax-path\* variable does not need
to be defined, but not doing so will result in file not found errors
to the console, and no syntax highlighting. The syntax highlighting
used by default is
[google-code-prettify](http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/),
and I can't guarantee that any other one will work without fiddling
with the code.

Usage
---

First, generate the jarfile

    lein uberjar

Then, run it, with the config file

    java -jar spiral-blog-standalone-1.0.jar config

The blog will be generated in the output folder defined in the config
file
