Hey! Welcome to the least-visited page of this site (hopefully). I
promise to
[never change any of the URIs](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI)
on this site, so someone messed up a link. If it was me, and you're
really angry, send me a note via carrier pigeon. Otherwise, send me an
[e-mail](mailto:odaypaul@gmail.com). If it was someone else, please
write a polite note explaining that they screwed up, and force them to
eat it. Then, go back to [my home page](/), and try to find what you
were looking for.
